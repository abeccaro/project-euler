Consider the infinite polynomial series A<sub>G</sub>(x)=xG<sub>1</sub>+x2G<sub>2</sub>+x3G<sub>3</sub>+⋯, where G<sub>k</sub> is the kth term of the second order recurrence relation G<sub>k</sub>=G<sub>k−1</sub>+G<sub>k−2</sub>, G<sub>1</sub>=1 and G<sub>2</sub>=4; that is, 1,4,5,9,14,23,… .

For this problem we shall be concerned with values of x for which A<sub>G</sub>(x) is a positive integer.

The corresponding values of x for the first five natural numbers are shown below.

We shall call A<sub>G</sub>(x) a golden nugget if x is rational, because they become increasingly rarer; for example, the 20th golden nugget is 211345365.

Find the sum of the first thirty golden nuggets.
