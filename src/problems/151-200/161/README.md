Any n by m grid for which nxm is divisible by $3$ can be tiled with triominoes.<br />
If we consider tilings that can be obtained by reflection or rotation from another tiling as different there are $41$ ways a $2$ by $9$ grid can be tiled with triominoes:

In how many ways can a $9$ by $12$ grid be tiled in this way by triominoes?
