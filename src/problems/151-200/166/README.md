A $4\textrm{x}4$ grid is filled with digits $d$, $0 \le d \le 9$.

It can be seen that in the grid

$6$ $3$ $3$ $0$<br>
$5$ $0$ $4$ $3$<br>
$0$ $7$ $1$ $4$<br>
$1$ $2$ $4$ $5$<br>

the sum of each row and each column has the value $12$. Moreover the sum of each diagonal is also $12$.

In how many ways can you fill a $4\textrm{x}4$ grid with the digits $d$, $0 \le d \le 9$ so that each row, each column, and both diagonals have the same sum?
