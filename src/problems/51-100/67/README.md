By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

<ins>**``3``**</ins><br />
<ins>**``7``**</ins>`` 4``<br />
``2 ``<ins>**``4``**</ins>`` 6``<br />
``8 5 ``<ins>**``9``**</ins>`` 3``<br />

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom in input.txt, a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.

NOTE: This is a much more difficult version of Problem 18. It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 2<sup>99</sup> altogether! If you could check one trillion (10<sup>12</sup>) routes every second it would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm to solve it. :wink:
