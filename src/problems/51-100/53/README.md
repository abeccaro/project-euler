There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation, <sup>5</sup>C<sub>3</sub> = 10.

In general,

![ncr](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5EnC_r%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bn%21%7D%7Bn%21%28n-r%29%21%7D)

,where r ≤ n, n! = n×(n−1)×...×3×2×1, and 0! = 1.

It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: <sup>23</sup>C<sub>10</sub> = 1144066.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of <sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub>, for 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, are greater than one-million?
