Triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal numbers are all figurate (polygonal) numbers and are generated by the following formulae:

The ordered set of three 4-digit numbers: 8128, 2882, 8281, has three interesting properties.

* The set is cyclic, in that the last two digits of each number is the first two digits of the next number (including the last number with the first).
* Each polygonal type: triangle (P<sub>3,127</sub> = 8128), square (P<sub>4,91</sub> = 8281), and pentagonal (P<sub>5,44</sub> = 2882), is represented by a different number in the set.
* This is the only set of 4-digit numbers with this property.

Find the sum of the only ordered set of six cyclic 4-digit numbers for which each polygonal type: triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal, is represented by a different number in the set.
