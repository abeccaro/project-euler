Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

<ins>**``21``**</ins>`` 22 23 24 ``<ins>**``25``**</ins><br />
``20  ``<ins>**``07``**</ins>``  08  ``<ins>**``09``**</ins>`` 10``<br />
``19  06  ``<ins>**``01``**</ins>``  02 11``<br />
``18  ``<ins>**``05``**</ins>``  04  ``<ins>**``03``**</ins>`` 12``<br />
<ins>**``17``**</ins>`` 16 15 14 ``<ins>**``13``**</ins><br />

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
