My solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems.

**Spoiler Alert**: As Project Euler website suggests, you should solve these exercises by yourself instead of looking at solutions.
Here you will find working programs!

These problems are solved in my free time to have some fun with maths (hopefully learning something in the process) and improve my lacking c++ skills.

As they are a personal project and I don't plan on improving old solutions as I get better, programs are not well commented.

Lastly if you took the challenge as well and you want to see my progress, feel free to add me as friend: 1104257_WnDIrVlbgx254ldPgqGJWZydBs3lTWoi
