Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

Triangle &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&thinsp; T<sub>n</sub> = n(n+1)/2 &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...<br/>
Pentagonal &emsp; P<sub>n</sub> = n(3n−1)/2 &emsp; 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...<br/>
Hexagonal &emsp;&nbsp; H<sub>n</sub> = n(2n−1) &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...<br/>

It can be verified that T<sub>285</sub> = P<sub>165</sub> = H<sub>143</sub> = 40755.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
